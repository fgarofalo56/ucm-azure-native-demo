# PRP Debug - Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Your Mission

Perform deep root cause analysis using the 5 Whys methodology. Don't just find what's broken - find WHY it's broken.

**Core Principle**: Symptoms lie, root causes tell the truth. Keep asking "why" until you hit the fundamental issue.

---

## Phase 1: DEFINE - Understand the Problem

### 1.1 Capture the Observable Problem

```markdown
**Observable Symptom**:
{What the user sees/experiences}

**Expected Behavior**:
{What should happen instead}

**When It Occurs**:
{Conditions, triggers, frequency}

**Impact**:
{Who/what is affected}
```

### 1.2 Gather Evidence

- Error messages (exact text)
- Stack traces
- Log entries
- User reports
- Reproduction steps

---

## Phase 2: INVESTIGATE - Trace the Failure

### 2.1 Locate the Failure Point

Search codebase for:
- Error messages
- Function names from stack traces
- Variables or values mentioned
- Related functionality

### 2.2 Trace the Flow

Map the execution path:

```
Input -> [Step 1] -> [Step 2] -> [FAILURE HERE] -> Expected Output
                              |
                        Actual Output (wrong)
```

### 2.3 Identify the Gap

What's different between expected and actual?

---

## Phase 3: ANALYZE - Apply 5 Whys

### 3.1 Structured Analysis

```markdown
## 5 Whys Analysis

**Problem Statement**: {Observable symptom in one sentence}

---

### Why 1: Why does {symptom} occur?

**Answer**: {First-level cause}

**Evidence**:
- File: `{path}:{lines}`
- Observation: {what the code shows}

---

### Why 2: Why does {cause 1} happen?

**Answer**: {Second-level cause}

**Evidence**:
- File: `{path}:{lines}`
- Observation: {what leads to cause 1}

---

### Why 3: Why does {cause 2} happen?

**Answer**: {Third-level cause}

**Evidence**:
- File: `{path}:{lines}`
- Observation: {what leads to cause 2}

---

### Why 4: Why does {cause 3} happen?

**Answer**: {Fourth-level cause}

**Evidence**:
- File: `{path}:{lines}`
- Observation: {what leads to cause 3}

---

### Why 5: Why does {cause 4} happen?

**Answer**: {FUNDAMENTAL ROOT CAUSE}

**Evidence**:
- File: `{path}:{lines}`
- Observation: {the core issue}

---

## Root Cause Identified

{Clear statement of the fundamental issue}

**Category**: [Design Flaw | Implementation Bug | Configuration Error | External Dependency | Missing Validation | Race Condition | Data Corruption | Other]
```

### 3.2 Validate Root Cause

Ask yourself:
- If we fix this root cause, will the symptom go away?
- Is this the FUNDAMENTAL cause, or just another symptom?
- Could we have stopped earlier, or should we go deeper?

---

## Phase 4: OUTPUT - Summary

```markdown
## Debug Analysis Complete

**Problem**: {One-line symptom}
**Root Cause**: {One-line root cause}
**Location**: `{file}:{lines}`

### 5 Whys Summary

1. {Symptom} -> because
2. {Cause 1} -> because
3. {Cause 2} -> because
4. {Cause 3} -> because
5. {Cause 4} -> **ROOT CAUSE**: {fundamental issue}

### Recommended Fix

{Brief description of recommended approach}

### Next Steps

1. Review the analysis
2. Create implementation plan: `/prp-plan "fix {problem}"`
3. Implement and validate
```

## Common Root Cause Categories

| Category | Example | Typical Fix |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Design Flaw** | Wrong abstraction | Refactor architecture |
| **Implementation Bug** | Off-by-one error | Fix the logic |
| **Missing Validation** | No null check | Add validation |
| **Race Condition** | Concurrent access | Add synchronization |
| **Configuration Error** | Wrong setting | Fix config |
| **External Dependency** | API changed | Update integration |
| **Data Corruption** | Invalid state | Add constraints |
| **Missing Test** | Untested edge case | Add test coverage |

## Tips for Effective 5 Whys

1. **Stay specific** - Avoid vague answers like "it's buggy"
2. **Use evidence** - Every "why" should have supporting code/logs
3. **Go deep enough** - Stop when you hit something actionable
4. **Don't go too deep** - "Why does the language work that way" is too far
5. **Consider multiple paths** - Sometimes there are parallel causes
